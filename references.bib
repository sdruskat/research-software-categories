abstract = {Introduction
Epidemiological data collection is often challenged by low response and, in the case of cohorts, poor long-term compliance, i.e. a high drop-out. For the correct recording of incident or recurring health events, that are subject to recall difficulties, gathering of data during the event and immediate response of the participants is crucial. This is especially true when biosampling that catches a transient biological situation like COVID-19 is involved. In addition, emerging research topics (e.g. pandemics like the current SARS-CoV-2) demand a flexible approach regarding content while allowing for complex and varying study designs. To meet these needs, we developed an eResearch system for prospective monitoring and management of incident health events (PIA).
Methods
Programming PIA focusses on IT security and data protection as well as aiming for a user-friendly and motivating design e.g. through feedback for study participants. The main building blocks of the infrastructure are identical functionalities in web-based, iOS and Android compatible application to strengthen the user acceptance of the participants. The backend consists of services and databases, which are all containerised using Docker containers. All programming is based on the JavaScript ecosystem as this is widely used and well supported.
Results
PIA offers complete management of observational epidemiological studies with six different roles: PIA administrator, researcher, participant manager, study nurse, consent manager and participant. Each role has a specific interface, so that different functions e.g. implementation of new questionnaires, administration of biosamples or management of participant contacts can be performed by different personae. PIA can be integrated in the IT system of ongoing studies like the German National Cohort but also used as stand-alone system. The software is open source (AGPL3.0): https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/pia-system.
Discussion
Despite the abundance of existing Electronic Data Capture Systems (EDC systems), we developed our own generic tool that combines monitoring and management in order to use it for specific applications e.g. in certain pre-existing epidemiological studies or for syndromic surveillance in the current pandemic. Hence, PIA is continuously adapted to emerging requirements. Currently, systematic feedback from users is collected. We aim to improve the user experience of PIA as well as provide further feedback and additional elements like gamification in the future.}
